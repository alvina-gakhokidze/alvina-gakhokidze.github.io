Hello! My name is Alvina Gakhokidze, and I am a third-year electrical engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I chose to study electrical engineering because of the creative freedom that this field allows, and I hope this will be conveyed to you as you read through my projects below.

Below are the fundamental engineering classes I have taken so far:
