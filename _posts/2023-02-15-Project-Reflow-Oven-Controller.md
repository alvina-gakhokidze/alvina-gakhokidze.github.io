<b>Status:</b> Completed Electrical Project for ELEC 291, a course at UBC. <b>Role:</b> Co-Leader. 

## Quick Description

The goal of this project was to design a reflow oven controller, completed completely in <b>8051 Assembly.</b>

The controller sends PWM signals to control a solid-state relay box that is hooked up to the reflow oven. The controller managed the temperature rise, pause, and cool-down, and had a temperature sensor to ensure that the oven was behaving accordingly. 

The buttons controlled the parameters of the reflow process, and we had audio output on the speaker that indicated the different "milestones" the oven achieved as it was going through the reflow process. 

We had to implement a finite-state-machine with 8051 assembly to
