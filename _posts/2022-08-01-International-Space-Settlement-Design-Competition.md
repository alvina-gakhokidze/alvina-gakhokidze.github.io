The International Space Settlement Design Competition Experience (ISSDC) competition I participated in as a high school student, and later on volunteered for as a university student. You can find the information on [Space Settlement Design Competitions](https://spaceset.org/what/). 

## Quick Description
The ISSDC is a simulated industry experience that lets students act as engineers and respond to a hypothetical Request for Proposal (RFP) over the course of a few days. First, there are regional competitions (I participated in the Canadian ones), and students who qualify are then invited to the international competition, which takes place in Florida. Professional NASA, Boeing (and more) volunteer to be "CEOs" of the student "companies" and mentor students during the design process. 

Below is a summary of my times participating and volunteering:

## Experience as a Participant

1. May 2019, Participant in the 2019 Canadian Space Settlement Design Competition - Group Size: 20 people per "company".
2. July 2019, Participant and part of the <b> Winning Team </b> in the 2019 International Space Settlement Design Competition - Group size: 50-60 people per "company". 
3. May 2020, Participant in the 2020 Canadian Space Settlement Design Competition - Group Size: Individual (due to Covid).
4. July 2020, Participant in the 2020 International Space Settlement Design Competition - Group Size: 50-60 Students per "company". <b> Distinguished for my work, and received the Dick Edwards Leadership Award </b>

### Notable work

#### May 2020 Semi-Finals

In the May 2020 finals, I wrote a 3000-word proposal, designing a space settlement on Mars. This submission successfully qualified me for the international competition that year :)

I designed the space settlement in Minecraft (including showing the construction sequence), and drew the various robots and designs myself.

#### July 2020 Finals

In the May 2020 finals,  I designed the construction sequence of the settlement on my own. This involved doing heavy research on civil engineering topics, and the diagram below is a visual summary. 

This took approximately 18 consecutive hours of work and I received the Dick Edwards Leadership Award in my 60-person team for my initiative. Designing this sequence involved collaborating with several students from different sub-groups of our "company", and ensuring that each of them could develop their designs (eg robots, settlement timelines, etc) based on my sequence.
