## Quick Description
This was a project for our ELEC 391 course. I was in charge of the controls and operational firmware for this project. I used techniques like Q-design and closed-loop testing to develop a robust controls sytem for the cheap DC motors that we were given. In addition, I developed efficient firmware while taking timing and complexity analysis into consideration. I also made the PID and path planning from scratch so that the code would run as quickly as possible and minimize the discrete time step in the controls system.
