## Quick Description
I have had the opportunity to work on many different projects during my co-op at Ziyutec Inc. Ziyutec Inc. is an electrical engineering consulting company located in Richmond, BC.

Here are the descriptions for some of the projects that I have learned from the most :) Some details like addresses and exact issues have been omitted for the sake of privacy. (Please forgive the third-person language)


## Saskatoon Power Study

The client is in the process of installing level 3 EV Charging stations at over 50 locations across western/central Canada. Ziyutec was retained to provide a 3rd party power study on the proposed design. The power study for this location in Saskatoon involved two (2) level three (3) EV chargers and its distribution system. As the Electrical Designer, Alvina Gakhokidze, modeled the entire design in ETAP software, performed load flow, short circuit, and arc flash calculations, and generated the report.

## Plastic Bag Manufacturing Factory

This project consists of converting an existing industrial warehouse space into a plastic bag manufacturing facility in Vancouver, BC. The proposed project is a 2-storey industrial facility, including a production/warehouse area, offices, washrooms, and storage. The total floor area is approximately 7 653 sq. ft. 
Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the junior electrical designer. She aided the senior electrical designer in the site visit to record the specifications for the industrial equipment and inspect the incoming service and distribution equipment. 
Afterward, Alvina performed the load calculations to ensure that the new location could support the factory’s equipment and distributed the loads between the existing panels in the new building. Alvina also designed the upgraded lighting systems. 

## BC Hydro Electrical Service Coordination

This project consists of BC Hydro coordination to design a new permanent power service for a fourplex complex Vancouver, BC. 
Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the primary Electrical Designer. Alvina performed the load calculation according to CEC standards to determine the load of the fourplex. Based on the power results, Alvina determined the service size and designed the electrical room equipment layout and the service feeder path through the property. Alvina Gakhokidze is also coordinating with BC Hydro to place an LPT on the property. 

This project has a unique challenge where there is very little space on the property to place the necessary LPT. Thus, Alvina has to seek creative solutions and placements in coordination with the architect in order to satisfy the client and meet BC Hydro rules. This includes reading BC Hydro and CEC codes to find unorthodox methods such as providing two power services to the property instead of the typical one. This project is still ongoing. 

## Domino’s Pizza TI

The Domino’s Pizza Restaurant project is located on the main floor of an existing building in BC. The client wanted to renovate the space to be a restaurant, consisting of a kitchen, a dish-washing area, a customer lobby, an office, walk-in freezers/coolers, and washrooms. 
Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the primary Electrical Designer. The challenge with this project is that this restaurant only had a 200A panel that was already being shared with another tenant’s space. Thus, the maximum service size they could have was 100A. 
Alvina collaborated with the clients to find unique methods to reduce loads and substitute different equipment for ones with lower power consumption. Alvina also designed the upgraded lighting/power systems and services to the mechanical kitchen equipment. 

## Central Kitchen Electrical Service

The client wanted to renovate the space to be a commercial kitchen, which would require upgrading the service of the existing building. Ziyutec Inc. was retained to confirm the feasibility of the service upgrade. 
Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the primary designer. Alvina conducted a site inspection to analyze the incoming electrical service and distribution equipment in the base building’s electrical room. Afterwards, Alvina constructed a comprehensive single-line diagram and performed a load calculation based on the new equipment to be added to the kitchen to confirm that the service upgrade was feasible.  

## Jinya Ramen Bar Restaurant

This project consisted of tenant improvement work on a 3000 sq. ft. ramen bar restaurant located in Alberta. 
Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the primary Electrical Designer. Alvina coordinated with the clients to determine electrical requirements for over 40 pieces of equipment. Alvina performed the load calculations, designed the panel schedule, and designed the upgraded power/fire alarm/lighting systems. 

## 20-Unit Townhouse

The project consists of constructing three 3-storey townhouse buildings with one level unground parking lot (approximately 14,500 sq. ft.) located in Vancouver. The total building area (above grade) is approximately 26,800 sq. ft. 

Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the junior electrical designer. She aided the senior electrical designer in designing power/fire alarm/lighting systems for the units in the townhomes in conformance with CEC regulations. 

## Vancouver Golf TI

This project consists of tenant improvement work for an approximately 5 410 sq. ft. golf space in an existing building located in Vancouver, BC. The unit is a two-storey unit (main floor: ~1 000 sq. ft., second floor: ~4 000 sq. ft.). The first floor was designed to be a hybrid shopping area and indoor golf course, and the second floor was designed to be a gym and indoor golf course. 
Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the Junior Electrical Designer and performed site visits to record existing electrical equipment and services and coordinate with contractors and clients. Alvina designed the upgraded lighting/power/fire alarm system and electrical services to mechanical equipment to suit the new layouts. 

## Crystal Mall Bubble Tea

This project consisted of tenant improvement work on an 800 sq. ft. bubble tea store in Burnaby, BC. 
Alvina Gakhokidze acted as the primary Electrical Designer. Alvina coordinated with the clients to determine electrical requirements for over 25 sets of equipment. There were 3 existing panels at the location; Alvina performed load calculations to determine if the existing service had enough capacity, and carefully distributed the equipment between the panels while ensuring that none of the panels were overloaded and that all the panels had enough breaker space for the equipment it would support. 
Alvina also designed the upgraded lighting/power/fire alarm system and electrical services to mechanical equipment to suit the new layouts.
